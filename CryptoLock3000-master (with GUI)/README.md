# CryptoLock3000
Cryptographic Password Manager
Tom Jones, David Lee, Henry Hilton

Implementation of basic command line version complete, along with stretch goal GUI.

Run from terminal with `python master_password.py` and follow prompts.

To clear data and start fresh, simply open `infofile.txt` and delete the saved encrypted data.

There is also a fully functional tktinker GUI version that can be run with `python GUI.py`.
The GUI launches asynchronous subprocess threads that run `master_password.py`, and pipes back and forth the necessary data using stdin and stdout listeners.

Enjoy hacking the mainframe!
